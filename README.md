# Book-tracking

This application provides a comprehensive solution for managing your book reading journey. It allows you to:
Track Your Reading Progress: Maintain a list of books you plan to read, along with the start and completion dates for each book. This helps you monitor your reading progress and stay on top of your goals.
Record Book Details: For each book, you can capture detailed information such as the title, author, a summary of the content, and your personal rating or evaluation of the book.
Categorize Book Status: Classify the status of each book as "On Shelf" (to be read), "In Progress," or "Completed," giving you a clear overview of your reading journey.

## Studies
This project was created with the intention of studying the technologies: SwiftUI and SwiftData, using as a basis the content of Professor Stewart Lynch found on YouTube.
